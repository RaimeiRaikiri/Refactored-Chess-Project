# Refactored-Chess-Project

Welcome to the Refactored-Chess-Project! The purpose of this repository is within the name; it serves to refactor or to be more concise, to remake the project made for an assessment for my second semester of first year at university. I did not want to alter the repository as it could be used as a reference of evidence of my previous work, therefore this repository has been created. Made using:

- Python
- Pygame library
